## Contribution
If you wish to contribute to this project I ask that you follow some simple guidelines

1) Create a folder named the language you wish to add
2) Add the fizzbuzz code and a `run.sh` (`run.bat` as well if possible)
3) Minimise the complexity of the build system (if one exists at all)
4) Add `.gitignore` to remove the built file and anything else building the program would generate
5) Add `author.txt` and simply put your username/alias/name in if you want to take credit for the language. Leave it empty if you don't. Also add your name to the Contirbutors section above in this readme if you wish to.
