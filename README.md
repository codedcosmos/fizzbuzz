# fizzbuzz

The plan for this repo is to host solutions to fizzbuzz in as many languages as possible.

## Number of languages supported so far:
### 3

## Contribution
If you wish to contribute to this project I ask that you follow some simple guidelines

1) Create a folder named the language you wish to add
2) Add the fizzbuzz code and a `run.sh` (`run.bat` as well if possible)
3) Minimise the complexity of the build system (if one exists at all)
4) Add `.gitignore` to remove the built file and anything else building the program would generate
5) Add `author.txt` and simply put your username/alias/name in if you want to take credit for the language. Leave it empty if you don't.
